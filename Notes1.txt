-----------------------------------------

Session 1 : Take proper precautions

- Take proper precautions
* Understand importance of financial planning.
* Ideal grihasth life.
Before entering grihasth life, plan vanprasth life.

- 5-6 required things
* 1st : Simple living and high thinking.
* 2nd : Not to get carried awa (chaddar jitna per felana).
* 3rd : Not take any loans (Most Important)
> 90% of people taking loans, their life is ruined.
> Majority of people take loan to buy flat.
Married at 25, then normally at 30 take loan, 
to buy 1 bhk flat (50lakh) (10 lakh savings + 40 lakh loans),
emi will be 40k per month for 20 years, requires 1 lakh per month 
salary. Slowly becoming old, chilren will be born, expenses will
increase, salary increment will be taken by children and
family members, at the age of 50 years person hardly makes any saving,
only loans are completed. Now, children are grown up, working stamina
goes down, pressure increases as there is no saving. Tension for
children's marriage and study. Saving made during 50-60 age goes into
children's marriage or career. At 60's age retirement you have nothing.
This happens in 90% cases. Son get's married and daughter in law 
comes in home. Daughter in law knows that you have nothing but only home.
Son says should I work like you his whole life and give this home to me.
Know person can't sell home and go to village. Person has worked with
high pay. But at age of 60 he is at mercy of his son and daughter in law.
His wife also has to be mercy of daughter in law. Because he has no
money at age of 60. Now he spents his life begging at old age and dies
like this. This happens due to loan taken at age of 30 years of age.
> So, don't take loan, live at rented house, if regular shifting required
then do shifting.
> If your focus of Krishna consciousness is very clear, there is no 
problem to advance financially very nicely.
> But if focus is not clear, you will always be bewildered.
> 90% cases are observerd are ruined, all of them had good pay.
* 4th : No big dreams
* 5th : Very serious planning of your life.
Plan vanprasth before entering grihasth.
Either this figure of this age, whichever comes before, leave grihasth.
Can go abroad : should be clear about it and don't sacrifice Krishna consciousness.
You should know : how many years you want to work, when you want to have a child,
when you want to get retire, how much money you have to spent for your child,
how much money you have to spent for yatras.
Spiritual planning : 
From beginning time, when you are getting married, know your taste type
in Krishna consciousness (preaching, deity worship, chanting, hearing
Krishna katha, doing management), try to nurture this taste very nicely.
So, when right time comes, when everything is settled, so that
switching completely from material to 100% spiritual becomes easy.
Have strong and intimate connection with devotional activities during 
household time.
* 6th : basically 4 avenues for investments
1. Fixed deposits, postal deposits, kisan/indira vikas patra
2. Real estate
3. Gold, jewellery
4. Stocks, mutual funds
> Analysis has shown in long term point of view
stocks and equity mutual funds has given higher return
than other 3.
> How much is the higher return
Reliance growth fund scheme : pure equity fund scheme,
in 1995 this scheme into public, those who had invested 
1 lac. Then in 2015, it have had become 76 lac rupees. 100% tax free.

-----------------------------------------

Session 2 : Precaution to be in 5% profiteer

- 
How you have to take your saving or investment so fast and 
so serious from the early age itself.

* First case : Saving 5000 per month at age of 25 and retire at age of 60.
> 35 years duration
> Total capital = 5000*12*35 = 21,00,000
* Second case : 20000 per month at age of 35 and retire at age of 60.
> 25 years of duration
> Total capital = 20000*12*25 = 60,00,000
* Mutual fund SIP
> Return - 15% annum
If both of them invested
> Money will become at age of 60
1st case : 7.3 crore rupees
2nd case : 6.49 crore rupees
 
- To make possible investing for till 60 years age.
* Note : In stock market, mutual funds, equity there are always going
to be ups and downs. Can make loss if came out due to fear.
* Why market will go up in future :
India has population of 180 crores. 80% are living in villages.
In villages, before 15-20 years back, people used to go to temple,
they used to have kirtan, they used to have aarti, they used to come home,
they then read scriptures, then they go to sleep, then again in morning
they wake up at 4 am and go to nagar-feri kirtan, do some puja,
then go to fields.
Now media is effecting people in villages, such that, now when they come
back from field at 5-6 pm, then they watch TV till 1 to 2 am. 
Media has convinced them that they are out from the world and not enjoyed
this life, and people all over world have enjoyed.
Now when people get money from the field, previously they used to buy
seed, tractor, fertilizer, but now they don't put it over there, instead
they buy 2-wheelers, car, build home, gadget, mobiles, ac, internet etc.
Now, till they are not get frustrated from sense gratification, indian
economy is going to go up.
It will go till 30-40 years, till farmers are not frustrated,
and we all will go to vanprasth.
